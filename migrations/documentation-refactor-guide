Introduction
The WorkWise SA application consists of multiple React components that were initially developed with varying levels of optimization, type safety, and code organization. This refactoring effort aims to standardize these components, improve performance, enhance type safety, and make the codebase more maintainable.

Refactoring Goals
The primary goals of this refactoring effort were:

Improve Type Safety: Enhance TypeScript usage with proper interfaces and type definitions
Optimize Performance: Reduce unnecessary re-renders, memoize expensive calculations, and optimize data fetching
Enhance Maintainability: Follow consistent patterns, extract reusable logic to custom hooks, improve readability
Improve Accessibility: Add proper ARIA attributes, support keyboard navigation, and enhance screen reader compatibility
Enhance Error Handling: Implement robust error boundaries and graceful fallbacks
Support Testing: Make components more testable with proper prop interfaces and isolated business logic
Refactoring Strategies Applied
1. Component Logic Extraction
We extracted complex logic from components into custom hooks, following the principle of separation of concerns. This made the components more focused on rendering UI, while the hooks managed state and side effects.

Example: The FAQWheelPreview component's wheel rotation, item positioning, and animation logic was moved to a useFAQWheel hook.

2. Consistent Prop Interfaces
We defined clear, consistent prop interfaces for all components using TypeScript, making it easier to understand what each component expects and providing better type safety.

Example: The JobCard component now has a clearly defined JobCardProps interface that documents all available props and their types.

3. Performance Optimizations
We applied various performance optimizations, including:

Using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Implementing useCallback for event handlers
Using useMemo for expensive calculations
Applying debouncing for search inputs and other frequently changing state
Using React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
Example: The JobCard component is now wrapped in React.memo and uses useCallback for all event handlers.

4. Accessibility Enhancements
We improved accessibility by:

Adding proper ARIA attributes
Supporting keyboard navigation
Using appropriate HTML semantics
Enhancing screen reader compatibility
Using responsive design patterns
Example: The FAQWheelPreview component now supports keyboard navigation and has proper ARIA labels for screen readers.

5. Error Handling
We improved error handling by:

Implementing error boundaries
Adding graceful fallbacks
Using proper error types
Providing meaningful error messages
Implementing retry mechanisms
Example: The JobsSection component now has a proper error state and can recover from API failures.

Component Directory Structure
The refactored components follow a consistent directory structure:

Custom Hooks Overview
useJobFavorites
Manages job favorites with local storage syncing and optional API persistence.

typescript

const { favorites, isLoading, toggleFavorite, isFavorite } = useJobFavorites();
useAdminAuth
Checks if the current user has admin privileges and provides permission utilities.

typescript

const { isAdmin, hasPermission } = useAdminAuth();
useJobSearch
Handles job search parameters, API fetching, and result pagination.

typescript

const { jobs, totalJobs, searchParams, updateSearchParams } = useJobSearch();
useFAQWheel
Manages the interactive FAQ wheel with animations, rotation, and item positioning.

typescript

const { rotation, faqItems, handleRotate, getItemPosition } = useFAQWheel();
useUserMenu
Handles user menu logic including authentication state and user information.

typescript

const { isAuthenticated, handleLogout, userDisplayName } = useUserMenu();
Testing Strategy
We implemented a comprehensive testing strategy with:

Unit Tests: Testing individual components in isolation
Integration Tests: Testing component interactions
Snapshot Tests: Ensuring UI consistency
Accessibility Tests: Verifying ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
Example test improvements:

Added tests for new component props and behaviors
Added error state testing
Added accessibility testing
Added performance testing for expensive calculations
Added responsive design testing
Migration Guide
To migrate from the original components to the refactored versions:

Update Imports: Change import paths to point to the refactored components

jsx

// Before
import JobCard from '@/components/JobCard';

// After
import JobCard from '@/refactored/components/JobCard';
Update Props: Some components may have slightly different prop interfaces

jsx

// Before
<JobCard job={job} onFavoriteToggle={handleToggle} />

// After
<JobCard 
  job={job} 
  onFavoriteToggle={handleToggle} 
  initialFavoriteState={isFavorite(job.id)} 
/>
Use Custom Hooks: Consider using the custom hooks directly for more control

jsx

// Before
const [favorites, setFavorites] = useState([]);
const toggleFavorite = (jobId) => {/*...*/};

// After
const { favorites, toggleFavorite } = useJobFavorites();
Update Tests: Adapt tests to match the new components and hooks

jsx

// Add tests for new functionality
it('respects initialFavoriteState prop', () => {/*...*/});
By following these guidelines, you can successfully migrate to the refactored components while maintaining application functionality and taking advantage of the new improvements.
